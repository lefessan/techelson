(** Input/output signatures for the functors that create interpreters.

    All primitive datatypes should be formatable (`TFmt`). All other operations are
    domain-specific. The actual signature of the modules the functor of this module takes
    is `Theory`.

    When modifying things here, be very careful of the type constraints in the `Interpreter`
    signature. The abstract types in the conversion modules must be constrained so that the
    compiler knows what they are equal to in the rest of the code.

    This is what the main functor creates.

    Two kinds of interpreters will be created. The interpreter for the testcase, which will be a

    for the latter.
